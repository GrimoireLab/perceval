## perceval 1.1.0 - (2024-12-11)

**Bug fixes:**

 * Git stats not assigned with their actions\
   Git stats were not assigned to their actions in a commit for filenames
   that contain whitespaces. Instead, an empty stat was created like in a
   merge commit, where actions normally don't take place.

**Performance improvements:**

 * Git sync improved for `--latest-items` flag\
   The speed updating a git repository when `--lates-items` is set was
   very poor. The main problem was when the references were updated to
   the new hashes. All the active refs on the repository were modified,
   even when they were up-to-date. Now, only references updated on the
   remote repository are modified on the local one. Repositories are
   synched 2 times faster than before.
