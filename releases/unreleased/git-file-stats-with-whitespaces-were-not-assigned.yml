title: Git stats not assigned with their actions
category: fixed
author: Santiago Due√±as <sduenas@bitergia.com>

notes: >
  Git stats were not assigned to their actions in
  a commit for filenames that contain whitespaces.
  Instead, an empty stat was created like in a
  merge commit, where actions normally don't take
  place.
