title: Git sync improved for `--latest-items` flag
category: performance
author: Santiago Due√±as <sduenas@bitergia.com>
issue: null
notes: >
  The speed updating a git repository when `--lates-items`
  is set was very poor. The main problem was when the
  references were updated to the new hashes. All the
  active refs on the repository were modified, even when
  they were up-to-date. Now, only references updated
  on the remote repository are modified on the local one.
  Repositories are synched 2 times faster than before.
