title: Empty stats for moved/copied files in git
category: fixed
author: Santiago Due√±as <sduenas@bitergia.com>
issue: null
notes: >
  Stats about changes on a file were not reported correctly
  for files that where moved to a subdirectory. They
  were reported as an invalid entry and without
  action associated.
  For example, the file `dir/filename` was moved to `dir/subdir/filename`,
  but it was reported as `dir//filename`. Therefore,
  the entry of the file `dir/subdire/filename` didn't
  have the stats about added and deleted lines.
  This error has been fixed and stats are reported
  correctly.
