**Bug fixes:**

 * Empty stats for moved/copied files in git\
   Stats about changes on a file were not reported correctly for files
   that where moved to a subdirectory. They were reported as an invalid
   entry and without action associated. For example, the file
   `dir/filename` was moved to `dir/subdir/filename`, but it was reported
   as `dir//filename`. Therefore, the entry of the file
   `dir/subdire/filename` didn't have the stats about added and deleted
   lines. This error has been fixed and stats are reported correctly.
